            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Information Systems Analysis and Design involved a quarter long project where I, and a team of five other people, simulated
                    being junior systems analysts for a real-world client.</p>

                <p>The UW's Information School Curriculum Specialist was our client, and he had multiple issues with the iSchool's system of
                    creating and updating curriculum. The two biggest problems were that there was no version control of past documents and there
                    was no way for multiple parties to view one document at the same time. </p>

                <p>With myself in the role of Project Manager, our team met several deliverables over the quarter.</p>

                <p>We first created a <strong>Baseline Project Plan</strong>, which included the project's summary, key assumptions, a feasiblity assessment, a risk assessment, and a breakdown
                    of logistics (preliminary schedule, team contact info, etc.)</p>

                <p>We then performed a <strong>Current State Analysis</strong>. This included diagrams that we learned to create using Visio. We created As-Is
                    Use Case diagrams and As-Is Process Flows, displaying the primary actors of the system and the activities that occur. We also
                    analyzed the current IT's strengths and weaknesses, and articulated recommended next steps. </p>

                <p>Finally, we performed a Future State Analysis, which included To-Be Use Case and Process Flow diagrams. We stated our
                    recommendations and provided alternatives. Our groups solution was to trained users on how to use Sharepoint, because it was
                    already integrated and had all the features our client needed. These features were not being taken advantage of.</p>

                <img width="90%" src="img/processflow.png"/>

                <p>In the end, we synthesized all our documents into a final report and presented our work. It was an awesome experience to
                    participate with a real client and getting to practice creating some hefty documentation for our analysis. Examples of our
                    Baseline Project Plan (BPP), Current State Analysis, and Future State Analysis are available upon request.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>My mobile app design class was surprisingly one of the more difficult courses I've taken. The class was meant to reflect
                    what it's like to work in industry on mobile app design: the process was fast paced, and it left our group floundering at times. </p>

                <p>The process was split into 4 sprints.</p>

                <p>In sprint 1, we were tasked to create a design language for a mobile OS. The "big idea" our team came up with was to (attempt) to
                    design an OS that would make a phone capabable of doing as many things a computer can do. It was ambitious, and we knew we might
                    fail, but we wanted to go for it.</p>

                <p>In sprint 2, we created a styleguide and defined UI patterns for our OS. One of the aspects that our team felt made the phone
                    inferior to the computer was speed efficiency: having a mouse and keyboard tends to make application use/switching faster.
                    So we brainstormed gestures that we thought would be good to implement (i.e. nail taps and knuckle taps)</p>

                <p>In sprint 3 we designed the dialer, contacts, photos, camera, messenger, and e-mail apps. The apps I did were photos and
                    camera.</p>

                <img height="70%" src="img/photos3.png"/>

                 <p>In sprint 4, we designed the media player, notes, tasks, calendar, browser, clock and calculator apps. I designed tasks
                    and calculator.</p>
                <img height="70%" src="img/calc1.png"/>

                <img height="70%" src="img/tasks2.png"/>

                 <p>Through this quarter-long project, I learned how to be proficient with Sketch and InVision. I also gained experience in working
                    with a difficult team. Although it was challenging, I was able to rise to a leadership position and tried my best to make
                    our project as good as it possibly could. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>For my Human Interface Design class (HCDE 455) I worked with 3 other students to design an interface
                that's goal was to make interior design easier. The class walked us through different phases, each with
                its own deliverable. By week 10, we had a complete, functional prototype: a mobile app called Open House.</p>
                <p><strong>Phase 1 - Prospectus:</strong> Prepared a four page document outlining our project.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Team Identity: Name and motto</li>
                        <li>Product functionality: What is it supposed to do? What problem does it solve?</li>
                        <li>Features (preliminary): What features does it have and how much can it cost?</li>
                        <li>User population: Who will use it and why? In what environment will they use it? What is the market size?</li>
                        <li>Resources: People in the team + their skills</li>
                        <li>Constraints: Time to accomplish project</li>
                        <li>Project Organization/Schedule</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p><strong>Phase 2 - Project Characterization:</strong> In this phase, we conducted user research to
                understand the problem better. We also did some scholarly research on 3D interaction techniques and Virtual Reality.</p>
                <p>Each team member interviewed someone. I interviewed my cousin for this phase, who received a degree in
                    interior design. Our results revealed that one of the greatest challenges about interior design was
                finding inexpensive, quality furniture and being able to envision furniture (both online and in store) within
                your actual space. Our team wanted to focus on the latter issue: creating an interface that could assist
                the user in envisioning furniture in their space without the furniture physically being there.</p>

                <p><strong>Phase 3A - Persona:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Phase 3B - Storyboards:</strong> We sketched up a storyboard with our persona, Christian. The story
                was that he wanted to incorporate a sand castle as an accent piece in his living room but his wife wasn't having
                it. He used Open House to digitally redecorate his living room to have a beach theme and used it to persuade
                his wife to redecorate their living room in real life. </p>
                <p>In retrospect, we probably should have wrote our storyboard to solve the main problem Open House was meant
                to solve: seeing furniture in your home without it being there. The problem presented in the story was one our
                team wanted to include in the web version of Open House. In the end we only created the mobile version.</p>
                <p>Here are two of the eleven scenes we drew.</p>

                <img width="50%" src="img/10.jpg" />

                <p><strong>Phase 4 - Task Analysis:</strong></p>
                <p>For this phase, we identified the user flow for three tasks in our interface.
                We created a system map for the interface and made flow charts for each task. This is one of those
                flowcharts, which I created with Lucidchart.</p>

                <p><strong>Phase 5 - Flipbook Field Test Report:</strong> AKA Paper Prototype</p>
                <p>Here's a couple pictures of some screens from our first prototype, constructed with cardstock.</p>

                <img width="95%" src="img/prototype3.JPG" />

                <p><strong>Phase 6 - Mockups:</strong></p>
                <p>For this phase, one of our team members coded our design into a mobile app prototype.
                Open House features Augmented Reality to let the user view 3D models of furniture through their iPhone
                camera. We included a social aspect too, letting users share their designs and follow others for
                inspiration; we incoporated this because our user interviews reported value in others' opinions for
                interior design.</p>
                <!-- Prototype is "over quota" -->
               <!--<iframe width="570" height="930" src="//invis.io/4J5SS3JMF" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>-->

                <p><strong>Phase 7 - Prototype Field Test Report:</strong></p>
                <p>We ran some user tests with ourkak mockup and made changes to our design based on the results.
                Originally we included both virtual realitiy and augmented reality to our design, but our user
                tests showed that the average user had trouble differentiating how to get to one or the other on
                our app. Also, the augmented reality feature seemed a lot more popular so we decided to narrow our
                scope and focus on AR more. We also changes button and icon designs to be more clear.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I feel like including the social media functionality to Open House made our scope
                too large. Even if we had to learn the hard way, now we know better for future projects! </p>

                <p><strong>Phase 8 - Final Report:</strong></p>
                <p>Our final deliverable was a team report documenting the entire process.</p>

                <p>This was my final project for Client-Side Web Development (INFO 343). It was my first time
                    working with a group on one coding project and it was also my first time working with a client.</p>
                <img width="95%" src="img/gamer1.png" />
                <p>Our client, GAMER Group, is a research group here at the University of Washington. Their current project is to create a catalogue
                to document video games. Their intention is to be the go-to source for video game information, like how
                IMDb is the most reputable source for movie information.</p>
                <p>They needed a website that could be used for select people/organizations to document video games. So we
                created this website with a large, multi-page form to submit into the database.</p>
                <img width="95%" src="img/gamer3.png" />
                <p>Users can see the video games they submitted in the past and edit their user information as well.</p>

                <img width="95%" src="img/gamer2.5.png" />
                <p>I did the bulk of the CSS3 styling and helped set up the multi-page architecture. This project was one of the
                most challenging I'd worked on, because I had never coded with other people before and had never used
                GitHub collaboratively either. Working with a client showed me how important it is to have good commmunication
                on a project like this. Despite the many obstacles we faced, it was a rewarding experience.</p>
